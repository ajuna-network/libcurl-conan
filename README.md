# ðŸ“¦ cURL Conan Package

This Conan package builds and packages the cURL library, with an option for enabling WebSocket support. This custom version of cURL is provided because the one in the central repository does not yet support setting `ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS`. If WebSocket support is not required, the official version can be used instead.

## Requirements

- Conan
- CMake
- A C++ compiler

To build your project with Conan, run:
